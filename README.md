# Mall_Copper_Turf_Feud

## description and shoutouts 
a simulation of what competition can look like under cerTain conditions, using things like the BuTTerfly effect. 

Work inspired by a character called Tremworstensch (no relation), the specifics of which are forgotten due to the cyclic nature of the dawn of new things and the death of older things, not to sound cliche (or what not).
