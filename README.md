# Mall_Copper_Turf_Feud

## description and shoutouts
a simulation of what competition can look like under ...cerTain conditions, using things like the BuTTerfly EEffect.

Work inspired by a character called Tremworstensch (no relation), the specifics of which are forgotten due to the cyclic nature of the dawn of new things and the death of older things, not to sound cliche (or what not).

Although cerTain... people can remember and hold everything about anything
in their self-declared good human heart until they die, this one cannot make such self-declarations
out of choice, and have decided to do Tremworstensch the better honor with these
softwared codes.

Shoutout to that character Tremworstensch, that one whose remains were stomped, crushed, and incinerated, but who continues to live on through these softwared codes.

Ideas for simulations.
Everything can bes.
- Rising Sun The Snake vs. Eddy The Eagle : two vastly different
                                            entities.  
- Dead Walkers : Walking Dead Zombie and Rick the slick Copper Dick    
                 Shit.
- Wasteland : terrain possesses cerTain... properties at ...cerTain times.
- Replacement : see below
- Right-hand next :  always a future. a better. a worst. a turn. an outcome.
- Shame and Obedience : civilization needs standards. so people make them. or
                        break them.
- Shameless Tactic : Who's to say, tis te One Caesar? 
- Ethnic Harpy : think differences and charm. differences to complement.
                difference as the destination.
- Politzai Malakai: think police state.
